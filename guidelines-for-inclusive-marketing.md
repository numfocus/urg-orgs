## Guidelines for inclusive marketing

## Goals

* Blog post to be added to Numfocus site (end of Thursday)

* Continuing work on a more polished, shareable document (live on GitHub?)

## Rationale

* The language we use to communicate in recruitment matters.

* That language can invite others in, or cause them to self-select out.

* Language can signal that an organization has considered their environment (physical space and personal interactions) and how that environment leads to the promotion and success (or not) of its community members.

* Intentionally changing the language of external and internal communications to be inclusive and welcoming, can expand applicant pools and increase diversity at an organization.

* For such a change to be successful, a critical mass of current community members must agree to participate (and work to change old habits). 

## Possible Applications

* A public facing website or blog

* Recruitment tools, i.e., job advertisements, organizing a conference, finding speakers

* Internal education or training (e.g. related tips here: [http://csteachingtips.org/](http://csteachingtips.org/))

* Internal communication among members

## How to Use this Document

* This is intended as a resource for considering how you could use intentional language in your oral and written communication for **inclusivity**, particularly with respect to recruitment and outreach

* We are focused in the field(s) of scientific computing, open source, and technology, but the concepts are likely applicable in other fields, broadly

* The guide is intended to help you assess the inclusivity of your current communication language, and edit for the goal of growing a more diverse and inclusive community.

* It was developed at the DISC event hosted by NumFOCUS (29-30 Nov 2017)

## Considerations for Language 

1. Reframe hard skills as soft skills

    1. For example, a website could be a list of the technical skills required (python, machine learning, SQL, linear algebra, advanced calculus, etc…) or it could be a list of actions (problem solving, communicating complex topics to end users, designing workflows to develop new insights, copyright and licensing, academic publication, etc...)

    2. In an educational context: Clear skills listed as part of the curriculum and how those skills translate to real world problems

        1. Use clear language when describing those skills

        2. Use real world examples

2. Avoid gendered pronouns -- [resource on getting the pronouns right](https://qz.com/926596/how-to-make-your-office-welcoming-to-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-workers/)

    3. Related: Resource on descriptors that refer to personal attributes of gender, race, disability, and more: [http://hrcouncil.ca/hr-toolkit/diversity-language-guidelines.cfm](http://hrcouncil.ca/hr-toolkit/diversity-language-guidelines.cfm) 

3. Humanize education and community members

    4. Provide anecdotes from current faculty and students (example: American Statistical Association has an article in each of their journal publications about a statistician in the theme of "what does a statistician do when not doing statistics?".) 

    5. Show kindness and humanity

    6. Fail publicly (e.g. if you’re making mistakes you’re trying)

4. Expectations should be clear, along with an up-front COC (or something similar)

    7. As COC is enforced, should disincentivize bad behavior

    8. Confront disruptive behaviors head-on ([https://coast.noaa.gov/ddb/](https://coast.noaa.gov/ddb/) )

5. Be very intentional with word choice (e.g. some words are loaded with negative connotations, double meanings, or implied barriers) -- [inclusive language in tech](https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/) 

    9. Bootcamp vs workshop

    10. Hackathon vs collaboration

    11. Group work vs team projects

    12. Describe programs as instructions

    13. Hacker vs Engineer, Developer, Maker, Builder, Programmer, Specialist, Artisan, Architect, Helper, Code experimenter

    14. Eligibility

    15. Requirements 

    16. Qualification 

    17. Proficiency

6. Provide resources, helpful links, tutorials etc. to lower barriers to entry

    18. This includes putting accessibility up front. For example: tutoring/training resources, nursing/lactation rooms, childcare, mobility

7. Promote collaboration and creativity (this can show that diverse perspectives are valued - e.g. we don’t only want one "right way" to do things here)

8. Collaborative events

    19. "Deliverable" is an expanded community, not necessarily what is developed during the event.

    20. Collaborative events are not just about code.  Documentation, training materials, design feedback, ….  All of those things are more valuable when coming from newbies - can stress that in advertising.

9. Publicly recognize and "show off" community members who are doing well, making improvements, and contributing. “Catch” members behaving well or doing cool things!

10. Educate on [stereotypes ](https://depts.washington.edu/sibl/sapna-cheryan/) and [bias ](https://medium.com/inclusion-insights/unconscious-bias-faqs-b6f3ab58deb4)--
