# Guidelines for inclusive marketing

## Goals

* Blog post to be added to Numfocus site (end of Thursday)

* Continuing work on a more polished, shareable document (live on GitHub?)

## Rationale

* The language we use to communicate in recruitment matters.

* That language can invite others in, or cause them to self-select out.

* Language can signal that an organization has considered their environment (physical space and personal interactions) and how that environment leads to the promotion and success (or not) of its community members.

* Intentionally changing the language of external and internal communications to be inclusive and welcoming, can expand applicant pools and increase diversity at an organization.

* For such a change to be successful, a critical mass of current community members must agree to participate (and work to change old habits). 

## Possible Applications

* A public facing website or blog

* Recruitment tools, i.e., job advertisements, organizing a conference, finding speakers

* Internal education or training (e.g. related tips here: [http://csteachingtips.org/](http://csteachingtips.org/))

* Internal communication among members

## How to Use this Document

* This is intended as a resource for considering how you could use intentional language in your oral and written communication for **inclusivity**, particularly with respect to recruitment and outreach

* We are focused in the field(s) of scientific computing, open source, and technology, but the concepts are likely applicable in other fields, broadly

* The guide is intended to help you assess the inclusivity of your current communication language, and edit for the goal of growing a more diverse and inclusive community.

* It was developed at the DISC event hosted by NumFOCUS (29-30 Nov 2017)

## Considerations for Recruitment Language 

1. Reframe hard skills as soft skills. For example, a website could be a list of the technical skills required (python, machine learning, SQL, linear algebra, advanced calculus, etc…) or it could be a list of actions (problem solving, communicating complex topics to end users, designing workflows to develop new insights, copyright and licensing, academic publication, etc...)

2. Avoid gendered pronouns -- [resource on getting the pronouns right](https://qz.com/926596/how-to-make-your-office-welcoming-to-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-workers/)

    1. Related: Resource on descriptors that refer to personal attributes of gender, race, disability, and more: [http://hrcouncil.ca/hr-toolkit/diversity-language-guidelines.cfm](http://hrcouncil.ca/hr-toolkit/diversity-language-guidelines.cfm) 

3. Humanize education and community members

    2. Provide anecdotes from current faculty and students (example: American Statistical Association has an article in each of their journal publications about a statistician in the theme of "what does a statistician do when not doing statistics?".) 

    3. Show kindness and humanity

    4. Fail publicly (e.g. if you’re making mistakes you’re trying)

4. Expectations about both individual performance and community standards for conduct should be clear.

    5. Using clear language and real world examples to describe the skills possessed by your desired applicant will help prevent some individuals from self-selecting out prematurely. For example, don’t simply ask for a ‘rockstar programmer’ or even ‘an advanced C++ programmer’. What does ‘advanced’ mean to your company and project? Do you want someone who has written more than 10,000 lines of C++ code? Someone who has been working with object oriented code in C++ for more than 2 years? 

    6. Publishing and making visible an up-front Code Of Conduct (COC) is a great way to signal your community or organization’s commitment to creating an inclusive environment.

5. Be very intentional with word choice (e.g. some words are loaded with negative connotations, double meanings, or implied barriers) -- [inclusive language in tech](https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/) 

    7. Bootcamp vs workshop

    8. Hackathon vs collaboration

    9. Group work vs team projects

    10. Describe programs as instructions

    11. Hacker vs Engineer, Developer, Maker, Builder, Programmer, Specialist, Artisan, Architect, Helper, Code experimenter

    12. Eligibility vs suggested coursework

## Considerations for Ongoing Support Language and Actions

If you are successful in attracting more diverse talent/applicants/members to your community or organization, here are some considerations that might help you in retaining those people. 

1. Provide resources, helpful links, tutorials etc. to lower barriers to entry

    1. This includes putting accessibility up front. For example: tutoring/training resources, nursing/lactation rooms, childcare, mobility

2. Promote collaboration and creativity (this can show that diverse perspectives are valued - e.g. we don’t only want one "right way" to do things here)

3. Collaborative events

    2. "Deliverable" is an expanded community, not necessarily what is developed during the event.

    3. Collaborative events are not just about code.  Documentation, training materials, design feedback, ….  All of those things are more valuable when coming from newbies - can stress that in advertising.

4. Publicly recognize and "show off" community members who are doing well, making improvements, and contributing. “Catch” members behaving well or doing cool things! This will promote a sense of team spirit and call more attention to community members who do not easily advertise their own work.

5. Enforce and embrace COC

    4. Confront disruptive behaviors head-on ([https://coast.noaa.gov/ddb/](https://coast.noaa.gov/ddb/) )

    5. Incentivize behaviors that support the work/contributions of other community members. For example, imagine a situation where one community member is interrupted or spoken over; positively acknowledge the community member who circles back to the interrupted contributor or calls out the interruptor. 

6. Provide education on [stereotypes ](https://depts.washington.edu/sibl/sapna-cheryan/) and [bias ](https://medium.com/inclusion-insights/unconscious-bias-faqs-b6f3ab58deb4)
